Learn Practical Techniques and Tactics to Combat, Bypass, and Evade Antivirus Software

Antiviruses are designed to protect the end user from Malware threats (viruses, Trojans, ransomware, worms, etc.).

But does antivirus software do what they claim to do successfully?

To answer this question, we decided to research in-depth the leading antivirus products on the market, to understand how they work, their strengths and weaknesses, and how they can be bypassed.

You will discover the ways, conclusions, and recommendations we wrote in our new book, Antivirus Bypass Techniques, understand the basics of antivirus software, what are the engines that exist in almost every antivirus software, how each one of the antivirus engines detects various threats.

In addition, you will learn how to use basic static and dynamic malware analysis tools to gather leads to start antivirus research.

You will learn our two approaches of antivirus bypass research:

* Discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in one of the antivirus components.

* Use of a detection-based bypass technique.
After learning our two approaches, you will read about each approach separately, with practical examples of bypassing each engine that exists in antivirus software.

At the end of the book, you will learn what can be done and how we can protect antivirus engines from various antivirus bypass techniques.
